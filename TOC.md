## _Foreword_

I always wondered how I could share my experience and knowledge about the c++ language best for beginners I met professionally.  
Some of them seemed having been inoculated with some misconceptions of how to effectively use the C++ language, instead of giving 
them the straight foraward usage of the standard library facilities.

As with every programming language it's essential to know about how the standard frameworks and libraries work.

Unfortunately many teachers in _"academia"_ seem to confuse the C++ basics with it's origins coming from C, and unnecessarily confuse their 
pupils with compilcated concepts of memory management and usage of raw C-style pointers and arrays.

Also adepts coming from the Java or C# background are often confused about the real use cases for `new` in the C++ context.

All in all, my intention is to develop a new didactical concept how to approach the C++ language in concise terms.
