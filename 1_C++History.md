# 1 A bit of C++ History

## 1.1 The Origins

 - In **1979** [Bjarne Sroustrup](http://stroustrup.com/) a danish computer scientist began to work on an extension to the C programming language called _"C with Classes"_. In these years software engineers were researching about better ways of structuring larger software systems as these became of more importance in industry.  
The idea of _object oriented programming_ (basically: _"Encapsulate data structures together with the functions, that should operate on them, in modules called classes."_) came up, and a number of new programming languages were invented to realize these concepts (namely Simula, Smalltalk, Eiffel) around the decade of the C++ language origins.  
One of the strengths vs other languages C++ inherited from C until nowadays, is that it is a compiled language (i.e. everything is translated to executable machine code and no interpreter engine is needed to execute a program).
 - In **1983**, _"C with Classes"_ was renamed to _"C++"_, inspired from C's numerical increment operator, and the common usage to add a "+" to indicate enhancements for a software artifact.
 - In **1985** the 1st edition of Stroustrup's book _"The C++ Programming Language"_ was published, and commonly used as a reference before ISO standardization. At that time many basic language features like _type-safety_, _virtual-polymorphism_, _function-_ and _operator-overloading_ were already introduced at that time.
 - In **1989**, C++ 2.0 was released, followed by the updated second edition of The C++ Programming Language in **1991**. Some very essential language features like _templates_, _exceptions_ and _namespaces_ were introduced, and gave a stable base to evolve the language further using a _standard template library_. Some early contributors,- even before standardization -, were [Alexander Stepanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stepanov), AT&T Bell Labs and Hewlett Packard Research Labs.
 - In **1998** C++ was established as an ISO standard. New language features or deprecation of language features is managed by an ISO Working Group (subcommittee) [ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_JTC_1/SC_22)
 
## 1.2 Standardization 

The original C++98 ISO standard evolved with a number of improvements and additions over the recent decades:
